        comment: "I must admit, I was expecting a different scent with the name. The name made me think it would be more fall/leaves scented but upon smelling it unlit I was hit with almost a strong vanilla smell. I'm not a fan of food smelling candles so I was turned off, but I decided to see how it was when I burned it. I'm glad I did because it smells so much better when it's burning. I also love the larger size of these as I burn candles a lot and the less I have to change them out the better!"

I love my fruits, but when I want to break up the monotony a bit, I break out my Lemon Lavender, Fluffy Towels, and Soft Blanket for awhile. I thought this one would be too strong and perfumey, but it's not--it's quite pleasant and relaxing. I love the label and the wax color on this one--it fits in well with Spring and Easter decor and adds a lovely fresh scent to your kitchen area as well."

        comment: "This is by far the best rose scent I have come across in a candle, hands down. My career is in the sensory field which means I spend much of my day tasting and smelling, so I know a good scent when I come across one! But this candle has one critical defect that it shares with several other Yankee Candles: poor throw. I am coming across this more and more in Yankee Candles and it really makes me sad, because I think they do a great job with mixing their scents. I am disappointed because this is such a great rose fragrance, but I can't even get it to fill up my average-sized bathroom when I burn a 2-wick tumbler. I kept one tumbler and returned the other, the retail stores are always very good about taking back product if it doesn't meet all expectations, which I appreciate. So 5 stars for scent, 3 stars for overall because if you can't smell it when you burn it...well, then you can't enjoy it as much."
